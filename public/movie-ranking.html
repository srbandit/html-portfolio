<h1>My all time favourite movies</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Scream</h3>

<p>Maybe the first and best slasher of all time.</p>

<h3>Ghost in the shell</h3>

<p>along with Akira is probably one of the best 90's anime sci-fi movies ever made.</p>

<h3>Jurassic park</h3>

<p>There's not much to be said about this all time classic.</p>
